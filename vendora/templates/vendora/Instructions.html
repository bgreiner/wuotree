<p>In this experiment you are a representative of a
    retailer who sells a single product to consumers.
    You have to make inventory decisions for this product.<br><br>

The cost at which you buy the product is {{player.cost}} E$ per unit.<br><br>

The price at which you are selling the product is 12 E$ per unit.<br><br>

In every round you have to decide how many units of the product you
    want to order (O) from the wholesaler. After you decided how many units to order, consumer demand (D) will be randomly generated from a discrete and uniform distribution between 0 and 300 (which means that each number between 0 and 300 is equally likely to be the demand in any particular round). At the end of each round, you will find out the quantity demanded for that round
    and your profit (P) will be calculated based on your order decision and
    the consumer demand generated. Then the next round will start. <br><br>

The experiment has 20 rounds.<p>
